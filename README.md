## What is GearScout?
GearScout is a web-based tool that collects quantitative data on other teams during events. The app can collect data during all portions of a match. It is completely open and free to all FRC teams.

## What do I need to use it?
All you need is a device that can connect to the internet! A steady internet connection is **NOT** required to use the app, but you need it to send information. 

## How do I access and use the app? 
You can access GearScout [here](https://gearitforward.com/). A full tutorial on how to use the app is published [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ktJ9sY4cItUND7cP-sToWUVwU_pONIC9Bmkj8yvJlj8/edit#slide=id.g2b62d68ee77_0_288).
